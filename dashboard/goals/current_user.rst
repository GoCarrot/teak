Keep Current Players Engaged
============================

Keeping your current players engaged is the core of what we do at Teak. Having a strong foundation of current player engagement significantly increases the value of your user acquisition and new player retention efforts. Additionally by keeping current players engaged you'll have fewer lapsed players, which increases revenue and reduces the need for expensive reengagement campaigns.

This guide will use the following Teak features to implement and improve on techniques to keep your current players engaged

The Daily Notification
----------------------

The most effective strategy we have seen for keeping current players engaged is to send 1 - 3 notifications to a significant portion of your player base every day. When you're just starting out this can be a *lot* of content, so we'll focus on using a recurring notification campaign to automate a single notification per day until you're ready to ramp up.

The notification we're going to set up will be a daily mystery bonus. Each day your players will receive a notification that gives them a randomly selected prize -- sometimes a big prize, but usually a small low value prize. Whatever the prize is, it should always allow the player to progress at least a little further in your game. The randomized prize also keeps the notification fresh for your players, which improves click through rates.

KPI Goals
^^^^^^^^^

For a daily mystery bonus campaign we generally target

- Audience size of at least 150% of DAU
- 10% overall click through rate each day
- 3% of game revenue in return value

.. note:: Every game is different! These are guideline KPI goals, you may want to choose different ones.

Welcome to Teak! We've organized our documentation by common goals that people have used Teak to accomplish. If you need more information on a specific feature of Teak, check out the reference docs!

Goals
-----

With Teak you can

- :doc:`goals/current_user`
- :doc:`goals/new_user`
- :doc:`goals/lapsed_user`
- :doc:`goals/improve_user_acquisition`

If you're new to Teak, we suggest you do these in order. Increasing new player retention doesn't do much good if you don't have a strategy to keep those players continually engaged, and the most effective way to reengage lapsed players is to prevent them from lapsing in the first place. Thus the most important part of the funnel to focus on is current player engagement, with new player retention and lapsed player reengagement as auxilliary goals.
